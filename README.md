## Linked List Implementation

The linked list implementation in this repository provides a basic singly linked list data structure. It supports common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

## Multi List Implementation

The multi list implementation extends the functionality of the linked list by supporting multiple lists within a single structure. It allows for efficient management of multiple lists simultaneously.
